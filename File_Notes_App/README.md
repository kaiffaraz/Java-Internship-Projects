# 📝 Notes Manager (Java Console Application)

## 📖 Overview  
The **Notes Manager** is a simple **Java console-based application** that allows users to manage notes efficiently.  
It uses **file handling** (`FileWriter`, `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`) to **store notes persistently** in a text file (`notes.txt`).  

Users can:  
- Add notes  
- View saved notes  
- Clear all notes  
- Exit the program  

This project demonstrates **Java I/O (Input/Output), File Handling, and Menu-driven Programming**.

## ✨ Features  
-  **Add Note** → Save a note to `notes.txt` (data persists after program exits).  
-  **View Notes** → Display all saved notes from the file.  
-  **Clear Notes** → Delete all notes at once (overwrite file).  
-  **Exit** → Quit the application safely.

- **Concepts Used:**  
  - File Handling (`FileWriter`, `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`)  
  - Exception Handling (`try-with-resources`)  
  - Menu-driven program using **Scanner**
