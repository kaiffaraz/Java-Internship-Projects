# 🏦 Bank Account Simulation (Interactive Console Program)

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **Java-based Bank Account Simulation** that allows users to perform basic banking operations through a **menu-driven console application**.  
The program starts by asking the user for their **account holder name** and **initial balance**, then provides options to **deposit, withdraw, check balance, view transaction history, or exit**.  

It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes, objects, encapsulation, and lists for transaction history**.

## ✨ Features  
-  Create account with **account holder name & initial balance**  
-  **Deposit money** (shows credited amount)  
-  **Withdraw money** (checks balance and shows debited amount)  
-  **Check balance** anytime  
-  **Transaction history** with all operations logged  
-  **Exit option** to safely end session

🌟 Advantages of This Model

✔️ Easy to Use – Simple menu-driven interface, suitable for beginners.
✔️ Practical Banking Simulation – Mimics real-world deposit, withdrawal, and balance check features.
✔️ Transaction History – Keeps a clear record of all activities for transparency.
✔️ Encapsulation & Security – Protects balance data using OOP principles.
✔️ Extensible – Can be easily extended to support multiple accounts, interest rates, or file/database storage.
✔️ Educational Value – Great for learning Java OOP, user input handling, and menu-driven programs.
