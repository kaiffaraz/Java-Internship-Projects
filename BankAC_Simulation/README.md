# üè¶ Bank Account Simulation (Interactive Console Program)

## üìñ Overview  
This project is a **Java-based Bank Account Simulation** that allows users to perform basic banking operations through a **menu-driven console application**.  
The program starts by asking the user for their **account holder name** and **initial balance**, then provides options to **deposit, withdraw, check balance, view transaction history, or exit**.  

It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes, objects, encapsulation, and lists for transaction history**.

## ‚ú® Features  
-  Create account with **account holder name & initial balance**  
-  **Deposit money** (shows credited amount)  
-  **Withdraw money** (checks balance and shows debited amount)  
-  **Check balance** anytime  
-  **Transaction history** with all operations logged  
-  **Exit option** to safely end session
